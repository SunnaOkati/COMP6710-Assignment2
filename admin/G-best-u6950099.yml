# comment about what you collaborated on.
#
# Add as many "name+comment" entries as necessary
# (or remove it altogether if you haven't collaborated with anyone)


collaboration:
  - name: Ron
    comment: Ron made the class to clean it up, but all the contents/methods are mine, so I think it would count, although I am not sure Ron also expanded upon the playbutton (originally a challengebutton) to make it write to the board instead of a vBox



# I wish to submit the following classes as entirely my own (remove this if
# you want to just submit methods):
class:
   - Challenge.java

# I wish to submit the following methods as entirely my own (remove this if
# you want to just submit classes):
method:
   - Board.challengeGridVisualiser
   - Board.playButton
   - public void Start, I'm proud of the aesthetic achieved.
