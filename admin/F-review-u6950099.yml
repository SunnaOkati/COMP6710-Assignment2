comments:
  q[]: What are the best features of this code?
#  Task 2 - It is concise and well formed, the variable names are excellent.
#  Task 3 - Useful comments and variable names appear throughout
#  Task 4 -  Well structured

#Is the code well-documented?
#Task 2 - Yes, it essentially consists of one if statement and each condition in the if statement has its importance explained
#Task 3 - Yes, the comments are useful and consistent although they should be proofread for the sake of grammar
#Task 4 - Mediocre, comments were originally not very present until I commented through it myself, there is also still lots of code that has been commented out for no obvious reason
#
#Is the program decomposition (class and method structure) appropriate?
#Task 2 - Yes, the method just needed to check a String's structure against a rigid set of rules and did so with a very comprehensive if statement
#Task 3 - Yes, the method utilised the method created for Task 2 and then used appropriate loops to reach it's goal
#Task 4 - Yes, the majority of it's structure is given thansk to a for loop that has well formed hardcoded statements with consistent structure, there are two methods that are present after that that are also well formed due to their concise nature.
#
#Does it follow Java code conventions (for example, are methods and variables properly named), and is the style consistent throughout?
#Task 2 - Yes, methods and variables are well named and no information takes up so much space that it goes off the screen
#Task 3 - Yes, it is essentially an extension of task 2
#Task 4 - Almost, style is clear and consistent, but variables such as "Image a" aren't very helpful. Using "i" for a for loop is fine as it's reasoning is explained in the comment above it.
#
#
#If you suspect an error in the code, suggest a particular situation in which the program will not function correctly.
#Tasks 2 & 3 - There are none, they both appear to be wholly comprehensive if statements.
#Task 4 -  The string "a000b444" simply draws the b piece to the top left corner because it's not well formed, in my opinion the program should instead
#          maintain a blank canvas if the error message "wrong placement" appears
