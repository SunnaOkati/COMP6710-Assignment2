What are the best features of this code?
Task 7 - implement different component in the different part, make it easy to read

Is the code well-documented?
all class except class ChosenPieceImage - Yes, there some brief commends for each part(step) of the code
class ChosenPieceImage - although there is not any commend, it is easy to understand it

Is the program decomposition (class and method structure) appropriate?
method createContent() - so long, about 150 line, inplement different fuctions, maybe can divided into different functions and refer them
others - good structure

Does it follow Java code conventions (for example, are methods and variables properly named), and is the style consistent throughout?
Class Tile - No, cannot know what the class is use for from the class name and the short commend, after my

If you suspect an error in the code, suggest a particular situation in which the program will not function correctly.
class ChosenPieceImage - should add setOnMouseReleased() event to make the piece place in the nearest location
line 323 - setOnAction() can use lambda expression
line 334 - not neccesary to create a vertical box to display the Challenge, we can just show it on the board area
